### Nutrition Studies

*Warning*: This is evil (statistical) work. Do not go to the dark side. Do not try this at home.

This directory contains three files:

File | Description
--- | -----
`raw_anonymized_data.csv` | The FFQ and survey data from 54 respondents
`p_hacking.R` | An R script that performs 27,716 regressions
`p_values_analysis.csv` | The output data file listing the p-values

**Note:** This is an intentionally shady regression analysis, both because of the "p-hacking" or "data mining" behind running more than 27,000 regressions and because the statistics reported were the p-values of the characteristics (the independent variables).

**IN OTHER WORDS: THIS IS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF SOUND DATA ANALYSIS.**
